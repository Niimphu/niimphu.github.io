							For the Yogscast Jingle Game Jam 2024, I designed gameplay and wrote code for "Avarice", a 2D shooting game where the player must fight demons and try to collect money.
							The game features a unique mechanic where money is needed for all player actions; reloading, dodging, and abilities, and it also counts as the player's "health".
							<br>
							I am proud to say that our entry won the award for "Best Use of Theme" by a unanimous decision from the judges.
							It was a truly rewarding project—we created an intuitive, fun game with a well-defined scope, and coordinating a team of strangers across different time zones was an exciting new challenge.

							As part of the 42 curriculum, I developed "miniRT" with a fellow student, a simple raytracer in C that can render 3D scenes with realistic lighting and colours.
							Although it is widely considered to be the more difficult of the two options for this mandatory project, we opted for miniRT because it seemed much cooler and had more for us to learn from.
							<br>
							My responsibilities included the implementation of the raytracing algorithm for some complex shapes, coloured lighting calculations, and some of our own additional features to improve the output.
							Since the graphics library provided was rudimentary and required us to calculate and draw each pixel, once I added recursive reflections and anti-aliasing, the program performed very poorly.
							Due to this, I implemented multi-threading, which improved the rendering speed of complex scenes by up to 500%.
