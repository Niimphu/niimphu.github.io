						I am a UK based programmer with two years of academic programming experience and a Bachelor's in Aerospace Engineering from Brunel University.
						In my spare time, I like to make games in Godot, play games on my PC, and explore creative endeavors such as music, digital art and photography.

						Projects
					</h3>
					<div class="project">
						<p class="project-text">
							For the Yogscast Jingle Game Jam 2024, I designed gameplay and wrote code for "Avarice", a 2D shooting game where the player must fight demons and try to collect money.
							The game features a unique mechanic where money is needed for all player actions; reloading, dodging, and abilities, and it also counts as the player's "health".
							<br>
							I am proud to say that our entry won the award for "Best Use of Theme" by a unanimous vote from the judges.
							It was a truly rewarding projectâ€”we created an intuitive, fun game with a well-defined scope, and coordinating a team of strangers across different time zones was an exciting new challenge.
