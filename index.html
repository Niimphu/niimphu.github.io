					<h3>
						Profile
					</h3>
					<p>
						Hello, I'm Yison ("Yi-"" rhymes with "tea", and "-son" as in "Jackson"), and I am passionate about software and tech.
						I am a UK based programmer with two years of academic programming experience and a Bachelor's in Aerospace Engineering from Brunel University.
						In my spare time, I like to make games in Godot, play games on my PC, and explore creative endeavors such as music, digital art and photography.
					</p>
					<p>
						My main core values are creativity, curiosity, and integrity.
						I believe that logic and creativity go hand in hand when it comes to delivering a good product, and I am always eager to tackle a challenge and learn something new.
						Additionally, I bring both respect and fun to the team, and am always looking forward to meeting new people.

					<h3>
						Projects
					</h3>
					<div class="project">
						<p class="project-text">
							For the Yogscast Jingle Game Jam 2024, I designed gameplay and wrote code for "Avarice", a 2D shooting game where you fight demons and try to collect money.
							The game features a unique mechanic where money is needed for all player actions; reloading, dodging, and staying alive.
							We won the award for "Best Use of Theme", and managing a group of strangers from the internet from different time zones was a fun new challenge.
